//Task Manager Assessment Guidelines
//Track: iOS
//Module: Swift

//CORE OBJECTIVES
//The program should display a menu listing all possible actions the user can take.
//The User should be able to create new tasks.
//The User should be able to see a list of all tasks (Completed and Uncompleted).
//The User should be able to see a list of only uncompleted tasks.
//The User should be able to see a list of only completed tasks.
//The User should be able to mark a task as complete.
//The User should be able to mark a completed task as incomplete.
//The User should be able to delete a task.
//The User should be able to exit the program.
//The program should include error handling to account for incorrect user input in all areas where user input is required.

//EXTRA CHALLENGES
//Add a priority system to Tasks. Tasks should be sorted by the priority in each Task list.
//Allow the user to set a custom complete by date for each Task.
//    Allow the user to edit an existing Task by changing the title, task details, and complete by date.
//    Implement persistence for the app, so that the user’s list of Tasks persists between runs of the application.

//TASK DATA MODEL
//The Task Data Model should have the following properties:
//1. Title
//2. Details of task
//3 .Completion Status
//4. Complete By Date

//TIPS
//Make sure to be committing regularly and pushing those commits to GitHub! Very handy in case something happens to your computer or you want to go back to a previous version of your application.
//Break the program down into smaller pieces! Thinking about it as “Creating a Task Manager” is a lot harder to think about than “Create a menu and display it”.
